            <h4>Back to the Present</h4>
            Objective: To create a responsive, full-stack application using React<br/>
            The purpose of this project is to provide people with a website that can keep track of their Christmas wish list, allowing others to see what they want as 
            well as making sure the same gift isnâ€™t bought twice for the same person - this is done by having members 'claim' the items they are going to get. People 
            can create an account and form groups with other members in order to share their wish list. <br/><br/>
